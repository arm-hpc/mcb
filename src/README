The top level Makefile needs to have BOOST_PREFIX defined.  We use several 
boost headers but no compiled boost objects so a simple boost install
is all that is required.  Get boost from www.boost.org.  The getting started
document describes the build/install process.

There is a section in the Makefile called "User Defined Makefile Variables".
Fill in the blanks in that section.  The file Makefile.sample contains some 
example values for these variables for compilers in use at LLNL.

Typical way to run the resulting executable (MCBenchmark.exe) would be:

> setenv OMP_NUM_THREADS 4
> srun -N4 -n16 --ntasks-per-node=4 --cpus-per-task=4 ./MCBenchmark.exe 
>                           --nMpiTasksX=4 --nMpiTasksY=4 --weakScaling


This is run on a machine with 16 cores per node.  srun asks for 4 of these 
nodes (-N4) and for 16 MPI tasks (-n16).  The executable needs to know the 
desired MPI domain decomposition specified by nMpiTasksX and nMpiTasksY 
and subject to nMpmiTasksX * nMpiTasksY == total number of MPI tasks, in 
this case 16.
